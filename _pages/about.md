I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science at Northeastern University, guided by [Prof. Misha Pavel](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/misha-pavel/) and [Prof. Stacy Marsella](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/stacy-c-marsella/). My research focused on computational modeling of human behavior and physiology.  I'm looking forward to continuing my work in this exciting field!
