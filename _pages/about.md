START REPLACE --- I am postdoctoral research fellow interested in how computing technologies can be used to understand, monitor, and improve human health.
More specficically, my research interests include mobile health and health informatics, with a focus on quantitative behavioral assessment of neurologic disease.
My work frequently employs data science and machine learning methodologies to model time-series sensor data representing human movement.
In the context of digital and behavioral phenotyping and disease assessment, these data have the potential to 1) enable identification of subtle, early disease signs, 2) form the basis of more sensitive measures of disease progression to support clinical trials, and 3) support patient-centric and personalized care. 
This research is highly interdisciplinary, and I enjoy close collaborations with experts in neurology, neuroscience, and biomechanics. --- END REPLACE

START REPLACE --- I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and was awarded the 2021&ndash;2022 Outstanding Dissertation Award by the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences.
I was a member of the [AHHA lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ahha/) during my doctoral studies.
I currently work in the [Laboratory for Deep Neurophenotyping](https://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/research/laboratory-for-deep-neurophenotyping-anoopum-gupta). In addition to my research, I am helping to develop [Neurobooth](https://neurobooth.mgh.harvard.edu/), which supports time-synchronized, multi-modal capture of behavioral task performance.  --- END REPLACE
